          <p>If you're applying to law school, chances are you need to write a few essays for your application. First and foremost is the personal statement. But what is the personal statement? How should you write it? What topic should you choose? What does the admissions committee want from you?</p>

          <p>Stop. Take a deep breath. We're here to help.</p>

          <hr />

          <h3><i class="icon-chevron-up text-success"></i> <strong>Launch: Personal Statement</strong> is a self-guided online course that will walk you through the law school personal statement writing process.</h3>
