          <h3><i class="icon-chevron-up text-success"></i> About Eileen</h3>
          <p>Hi! I'm Eileen Conner, and I'll be your host this evening.</p>

          <p>After earning an MFA in creative writing from the University of Michigan, I became an active writer, editor, and teacher—but only recently have I been able to combine these. As Senior Editor for Law at Revision Editing, I helped hundreds of prospective students improve their personal statements, diversity statements, and addenda. Now, to reach even more professional school candidates, I've started Pen and Chisel LLC, providing tips, advice, and instruction to help you write great admissions essays.</p>

          <p>Here's what our customers have to say about working with Eileen:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I had the immense pleasure to work with Eileen Conner, and she was just great. Eileen would always provide a prompt response to any of my questions and she was very concise and through with her comments. Eileen’s willingness to take extra time out of her schedule to address all my questions, comments, and concerns shows her genuine care for her customers.</p>

            <p>On several occasions, she went over and beyond what was expected to help me out, and really worked hard to make sure that my essays were great. It’s evident that she has an enormous passion for what she does, and this was clearly reflected in the quality she produced. She was helpful, nice, and provided valuable advice that helped me construct a strong essay. I’m very optimistic about my chances during the application process and strongly believe that Eileen provided the extra 'oomph' I needed to make me a serious contender at all my top choices.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I want to thank you for the great work you've done and for all the awesome suggestions. It's evident that you put a lot of time and effort with everything in the commentary. I really appreciate everything you've done so far and am very thankful that I've had this opportunity to work with you.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote class="blockquote-final">
            <p>I'm 100% confident that your help with my LSAT addenda, diversity statement, and Why Notre Dame essay gave me the edge I needed to gain acceptance at all these great schools. I really consider myself lucky that I had the opportunity to work with you.</p>
