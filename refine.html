          <p>After a lot of hard work, you've come up with a rough draft of your personal statement for law school. Now, how do you improve it?</p>

          <p>Maybe you can tell that there's something wrong with your essay, but you can't quite figure out what it is or how to solve it. Maybe you're feeling confident, but you still want to make sure you aren't missing any major problems. Maybe you just want to ensure that your personal statement is the best it can possibly be.</p>

          <p>We can help!</p>

          <hr/>

          <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-up text-success"></i> <strong> Refine: Personal Statement</strong> is a self-guided online course that will take you through the most common problems in law school personal statements.</h3>

          <p>Throughout our seven-class series, consisting of 25 videos and corresponding exercises, we'll tackle everything from broad issues like on-target focus and good use of evidence right down to the most minute of grammar and spelling concerns.</p>

          <p>As we proceed, we'll not only examine typical personal statement problems&mdash;we'll practice solving them through targeted exercises. Then it will be your turn to apply what you've learned to your own draft: examining it in-depth, discovering any flaws, and editing or rewriting to dramatically improve the final product. By the end of the course, you will have produced an impressive final draft, ready for submission to the law schools of your choice.</p>

          <p><strong>Refine: Personal Statement</strong> is designed to let you work at your own pace, so you can balance your day-to-day responsibilities with your law school application process. Spend as much or as little time as you need on your essay's specific problem areas. Course material will be available on demand until August 31st, 2014.</p>

          <hr/>

          <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-up text-success"></i> Why choose <strong>Refine: Personal Statement</strong> over traditional editing services?</h3>

          <p>By learning how to edit your own essay instead of handing it over to an editor, you get a few definite advantages. First, more and more law schools are asking that applicants disclose the use of editorial services in their applications. If you write and edit your own essay, however, you can safely and ethically claim that your personal statement is entirely your own work.</p>

          <p>As well, by taking this class, you get the benefit of an entire targeted curriculum to peruse on your own schedule&mdash;instead of relying on an editor's potential availability. By doing your own editorial work, you stay in control of your time and your deadlines.</p>
